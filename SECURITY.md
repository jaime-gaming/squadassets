# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to keeping this community tool safe for everyone. Since this is a client-side application that runs entirely in your browser, security updates are applied directly to the main branch.

## Our Security Commitment

This explorer is designed with privacy in mind:

- Local Processing: Your ZIP files are never uploaded to any server. All processing happens locally in your browser's memory using JSZip.

- No Data Collection: We do not use cookies or tracking scripts that collect your personal information or the contents of your game assets.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security bug or vulnerability, please help us keep the community safe by following these steps:

1. Do not open a public GitHub Issue for security-related bugs.

2. Send a detailed report via a Private Security Advisory on GitHub if available, or contact the project maintainers through the official community Discord.

3. Include a description of the vulnerability, the potential impact, and steps to reproduce the issue.
  
### Respone Process
- Acknowledgement: You will receive a response within 48 to 72 hours.

- Evaluation: We will investigate the report and determine the severity.

- Fix: If confirmed, a fix will be pushed to the main branch as soon as possible.

- Disclosure: Once the fix is applied, we will credit the researcher (if desired) and disclose the fix to the community.

## Third-Party Libraries
This project relies on:

- JSZip: For ZIP file manipulation.

- Tailwind CSS: For the user interface.

We regularly monitor these dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
